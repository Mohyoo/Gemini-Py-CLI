*) The secret
This is just a quick puzzle to solve and get the password to open the
'Secret.zip' file.

The secret isn't really worth the headache, but you know.. just for fun.
Also, don't forget to bring a pen & paper :)

After solving the puzzle, the password must be purely digital, e.g: (1000000)
and not (1,000,000).
