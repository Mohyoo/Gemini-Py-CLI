## The Setup
An eccentric librarian has a massive circular shelf containing (1,000,000)
antique books. The books are numbered in a perfect sequence from (1) to
(1,000,000) clockwise (From smaller number to bigger).

A clumsy assistant was asked to re-organize them but made a specific mistake:

* They picked up ONE single pair of books that were sitting right next to each other.
* They swapped their positions.
* Every other book in the entire library is in its correct, numerical spot.




## The Problem
The librarian wants to find the mistake. He starts at Book (#1) and begins
walking clockwise, checking the numbers one by one.

He is looking for the first book that is out of place (the first book whose
number does not match its position in the sequence).

However, there is a catch: The assistant tells him, "I swapped two neighbors,
and the sum of the numbers on the two swapped books is exactly (1,500,001)."




## The Question
What is the NUMBER printed on the very first "out of place" book the librarian
will encounter as he walks clockwise starting from (#1)?
